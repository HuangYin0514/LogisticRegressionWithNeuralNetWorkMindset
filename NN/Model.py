       Builds the logistic regression model by calling the function you've implemented previously

       X_train -- training set represented by a numpy array of shape (num_px * num_px * 3, m_train)
       Y_train -- training labels represented by a numpy array (vector) of shape (1, m_train)

       Y_test -- test labels represented by a numpy array (vector) of shape (1, m_test)
       num_iterations -- hyperparameter representing the number of iterations to optimize the parameters
       learning_rate -- hyperparameter representing the learning rate used in the update rule of optimize()
       print_cost -- Set to true to print the cost every 100 iterations
